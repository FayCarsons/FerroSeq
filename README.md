# FerroSeq (working title)
A sequencer + sampler for the Monome grid.

Includes a sampler engine with slicing (currently constant # of slices), reverse playback, and a Nine Inch Nails inspired digital distortion effect, as well as a step sequencer for the monome grid.
The goal is to enable writing breakcore in an immediate, tactile way - mostly for fun.
The entire project is pure Rust and a goal is to keep it that way.

## Demo
You can find a short demonstration of the app [here](https://x.com/fay_carsons/status/1857574938527543470).
An annotated demo/tutorial should be available soon :3

## Future features
Basic QOL, deleting steps, per-step control over pitch.
Renoise-style timestretch/retrigger
Filtering
Dynamic slicing, BPM, and sample sync
