# FerroSeq (working title)
A sequencer + sampler for the Monome grid.

Includes a sampler engine with slicing (currently constant # of slices), reverse playback, and a Nine Inch Nails inspired digital distortion effect, as well as a step sequencer for the monome grid.
The goal is to enable writing breakcore in an immediate, tactile way - mostly for fun.

### Documentation for grid layout and demo videos to come!!
